# OpenNLP Lemmatizer Dictionary Generator
Lemma dictionary generator for OpenNLP's Lemmatizer base on CoGrOO PT-BR dictionary.

This generator uses CoGrOO dictionaries to generate a file which can be use as input for OpenNLP's Lemmatizer.

I made it because it was to hard to find an already formated dictionary expected by OpenNLP's Lemmatizer. 

## How to use

* Clone this repository
* Import the project using Eclipse
* Run `org.opennlp.dict.generator.LemmatizerDictionaryGenerator.main`
